# Metadata analysis for HMD using Siegfried
This repository provides a jupyter notebook that contains the procedure for various steps of metadata analysis for the HMD team using [Siegfried](https://www.itforarchivists.com/siegfried/). 

## Accessing the notebook
The notebook requires Python 3 and the installation of several python modules, most importantly jupyter itself! To install the required modules, the pip python package manager is recommended and should already be installed if you are using Python 3>=3.4. 

The use of a virtual environment is recommended!

Install the necessary packages with:
```
python -m pip install -r requirements.txt

```

And then access the notebook with
```
jupyter notebook
```
